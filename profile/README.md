# Dapps Project

##What is this?

This is a collaborative community software development project to learn and create decentralized applications.

##Why is this important, now?

There are a lot of software engineers who are and want entering into web3 space. Web3 development tech is obscure and scattered into blockchain specific ecosystems. It is difficult and overwhelming to realise a web3 business idea because of the breadth and depth of this tech stack. At the same time new tools and protocols are getting launched everyday, which can be useful to integrate into products. 

We believe that learning with community is much better than learning alone. 

This community is composed of seasoned web3 developers and entrepreneurs, web2 developers starting their web2 journey. All here to learn and create together 100 most successful dapps of next 5 years. 

We aim to create 100 open-source dapps with target aim of becoming successful businesses eventually.
